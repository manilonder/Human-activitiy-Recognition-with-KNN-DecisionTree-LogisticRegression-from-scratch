# KNN-DecisionTree-LogisticRegression-from-scratch
The kNN algorithm is belongs to the family of instance-based, competitive learning and lazy learning algorithms.

Instance-based algorithms are those algorithms that model the problem using data instances (or rows) in order to make predictive decisions. The kNN algorithm is an extreme form of instance-based methods because all training observations are retained as part of the model.

It is a competitive learning algorithm, because it internally uses competition between model elements (data instances) in order to make a predictive decision. The objective similarity measure between data instances causes each data instance to compete to “win” or be most similar to a given unseen data instance and contribute to a prediction.

Lazy learning refers to the fact that the algorithm does not build a model until the time that a prediction is required. It is lazy because it only does work at the last second. This has the benefit of only including data relevant to the unseen data, called a localized model. A disadvantage is that it can be computationally expensive to repeat the same or similar searches over larger training datasets.

Finally, kNN is powerful because it does not assume anything about the data, other than a distance measure can be calculated consistently between any two instances. As such, it is called non-parametric or non-linear as it does not assume a functional form.
